    "This tutorial teaches you how to combine traditional tick-based agent-based modeling with discrete event simulation using Mesa's `ABMSimulator`. You'll learn when and how to use hybrid models for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand when to use hybrid ABM-DEVS models vs pure approaches\n",
    "- Master the `ABMSimulator` for integer-time ticks + events\n",
    "- Combine spatial agent movement with event scheduling\n",
    "- Implement an epidemic model with event-based recovery\n",
    "- Benchmark tick-based vs event-based performance\n",
    "- Apply advanced DEVS patterns (cancellation, chaining, dynamic scheduling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Complete Tutorial 11 (Discrete Event Simulation) - REQUIRED\n",
    "- Complete Tutorial 1 (Adding Space)\n",
    "- Complete Tutorial 2 (Collecting Data)\n",
    "- Understanding of spatial models and agent movement\n",

    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "A spatial SIR epidemic model where agents move on a grid each tick (ABM), but infections and recoveries are handled as discrete events (DEVS), with performance comparisons and visualization."

    "## Recap: Pure DEVS vs Hybrid Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 11, we learned pure discrete event simulation with `DEVSimulator`:\n",
    "- Float-based continuous time (0.0, 1.3, 2.7, 5.2, ...)\n",
    "- Only scheduled events execute\n",
    "- Perfect for queuing systems, arrivals, service processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation**: No automatic tick-based agent activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Do We Need Hybrid Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need both approaches:\n",
    "- Agents move/interact every tick (spatial dynamics)\n",
    "- But certain state changes happen at specific times (events)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Epidemic spread\n",
    "- Movement: Every tick (agents walk around)\n",
    "- Recovery: Scheduled event (after random duration)\n",

    "   - Easy to add states (e.g., EXPOSED for SEIR)\n",

    "   - Can check if recovery is scheduled\n",

    "4. **recovery_delay randomness**: Uniform(10, 20)\n",
    "   - Realistic: recovery time varies by individual\n",
    "   - Could use other distributions (exponential, normal)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Exposed agents are NOT contagious\n",
    "4. Update visualization to show 4 states\n",
    "5. Track epidemic curve for all 4 compartments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starter Code**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PersonSEIR(Person):\n",
    "    EXPOSED = 1\n",

    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. 20% of susceptible agents get vaccinated each tick\n",
    "2. Vaccinated agents go directly to `RECOVERED` (immune)\n",
    "3. Stop vaccination when 70% are immune (recovered + vaccinated)\n",

    "\n",
    "Agents adapt their behavior based on local epidemic severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Agents track infected neighbors in Moore neighborhood\n",
    "2. If >3 infected neighbors: reduce movement (move with 30% probability)\n",

    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Hospital has limited beds (20% of population)\n",
